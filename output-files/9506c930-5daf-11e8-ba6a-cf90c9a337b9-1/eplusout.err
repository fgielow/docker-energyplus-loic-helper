   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction INOVO SUSPENDED FLOOR of interzone surface 02PLENUM:VOID_FLOOR_0_1_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction INOVO SUSPENDED FLOOR_REV of adjacent surface 02FFE:OFFICEXNEXLED_CEILING_1_0_10004
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction PROJECT PARTITION of interzone surface 02FFE:OFFICEXNEXLED_PARTITION_5_0_0 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction PROJECT PARTITION_REV of adjacent surface 02FFE:OFFICEXN_PARTITION_6_0_10022
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 6 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 7 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 5 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** DeterminePolygonOverlap: Too many figures [>15000]  detected in an overlap calculation. Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; for more details.
   ** Warning ** DeterminePolygonOverlap: Too many vertices [>15] detected in an overlap calculation. Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; for more details.
   ** Warning ** Detailed daylighting will not be done for zone=02FFE:OFFICEXNE
   **   ~~~   ** because it has no associated exterior windows.
   ** Severe  ** InitHeatBalFiniteDiff: Construction ="IRTSURFACE" uses Material:InfraredTransparent. Cannot be used currently with finite difference calculations.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if this construction were used in a surface, the simulation would be terminated.
   ** Warning ** Calculated design cooling load for zone=02FFE:OFFICEXMEETXSSEXLED is zero.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
   ************* Material:InfraredTransparent usage
   ************* ..Using Material:InfraredTransparent materials in constructions are correctly used in interzone surface
   ************* ..constructions. Warnings are given if they are used in other kinds of surfaces.
   ************* ..They CANNOT currently be used with ConductionFiniteDifference algorithms.
